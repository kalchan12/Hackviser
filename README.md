# 🛡️ Certified Associate Penetration Tester (CAPT)

> _From zero to breaking (ethically)._  
> This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through the **Certified Associate Penetration Tester (CAPT)** program on **Hackviser**.

This is not just notes. This is proof of **learning, thinking, breaking, fixing, and documenting like a real pentester**.

## 🎯 What is CAPT?

The **Certified Associate Penetration Tester (CAPT)** certification is designed for newcomers to cybersecurity who want to actually _do_ penetration testing—not just read about it.

It focuses on:

- Real-world attack scenarios
    
- Hands-on labs
    
- Practical assessments
    
- Ethical hacking principles
    

In short: _less theory-only, more keyboard time._
